This is a full rewrite based off of Ogar/MultiOgar/MultiOgar-Edited that ended up being better than I originally expected. The code is clean and logical in most situations. The agar protocol is fully supported - up from version 4 all the way to 17.

The project is still under developement. The basics work as expected so you're encouraged to go bug hunting.

**DON'T** ask what additional features will it bring. It's not even finished.

**DON'T** go around asking how do I do this how do I do that. You have the [MultiOgar-Edited Discord guild](https://discord.gg/27v68Sb) for that.

Pull requests are not welcome, OgarII-Chan is mine.
